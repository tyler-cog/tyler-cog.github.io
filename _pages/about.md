I'm Tyler, I graduated from Texas A&M with a Bachelor in Computer Science and a minor in Japanese!

With my experience at Texas A&M IT Department, I've honed my skills in customer service, management, and technical support.
Whereas my projects, like the Vehicle Identification for Walmart and Colorization, showcase my proficiency in Python and innovative problem-solving. 

I would also consider myself adept in Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++, with strong communication
skills and expertise in data structures, algorithms, databases, and more. 

Currently looking for any opportunities to better my skills as a Software Developer!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
