    Assignment Stacker was a project that came out of an issue my group was having, in that A&M classes typically were based off different websites like Blackboard, Google Classroom, Canvas, etc. Resulting in giving us a headache as we search for assignments, due dates, and so on across different sites with different sorting methods.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/assignStack.jpg" title="assignStackHome" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

    Above was the main page, here after you created an account, you would import your Classes in order to fill the main page with your corresponding classes and within those classes the current assignments that were available or open to complete along with the dates they were due. You were able to sort by Classes, Due Dates, Assignments, and so on which made it very easy to keep track of everything all in one place.

    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/assignNotif.jpg" title="assignStackNotif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

    On the notification page, you were able to change when and how you received notifications on when assignments were due customizing it to fit how you like it.
