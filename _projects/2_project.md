    This is a indepth database built on the basis of a fast food restaurant. It includes numerous different views for both an Employee and a Manager with the ability to create orders, invoices, reciepts, as well as edit, delete, while also changing the corresponding ingredients associated with the orders involved as well. (Sorry for the lack of photos)
