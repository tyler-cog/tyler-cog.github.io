    First to clarify, Zato is the character I play in Guilty Gear Strive. While not yet finished the idea of this project is to create a desktop pet type widget similar to <a href='https://twitter.com/carryberto/status/1763990210856034713'> this twitter post.</a> Though it is going to work fairly different, I want a mini Zato to walk around the screen and be interactable in different ways.

    <div class="col-sm-10 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/zatoPet.JPG" title="zatoPet" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

    Above is a small snippet, currently we walks around transitioning between his flying and walking animation. As for an end goal, I think I want Zato to be able to fly around the screen in random intervals, and possibly even be able to perform some of his specials from the fighting game and summon his puppet, Eddie, but my ideas haven't been realized just yet, stay tuned!
